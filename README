Communication App that does the following:
- Stakeholder A talks to Stakeholder B about current shipping process
    - While talking, information is updated in the database
- Stakeholder A initiates Document A to be filled out automatically
    - Information is retrieved in three manners: 
        - Database/Stored information from conversation
        - Database connection by either Stakeholder A or Stakeholder B
        - Natural Language Prompting by Stakeholder A
    - This information is parsed and an AI agent fills Document A out
- Stakeholder A sends Document A to Stakeholder B for verification
- If mistake is found by Stakeholder B, then Stakeholder A fixes it
    - Either through NLP
    - By Manual Entry
- This process repeats until both parties verify the document is correct
